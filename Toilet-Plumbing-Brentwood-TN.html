<p>Usually across the country, it costs between $120 and $150 to install a garbage disposal. The average cost of waste disposal unit installation depends on several elements: the type of garbage disposal, whether it's a new disposal installation or replacement of an old system, and if extra electrical connections or plumbing work is necessary.
