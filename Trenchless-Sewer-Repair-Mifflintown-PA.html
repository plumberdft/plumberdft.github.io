The best strainers have either a spin-lock or a twist-and-drop style stopper. The spin-lock stopper does not have any parts that can use, however screwing it in and out can be annoying.

<p>A. If you have rust areas, using phosphoric acid normally will help eliminate them. , if you would like to attempt the gentlest technique possibly try utilizing some Coke on the rust first.. No, we aren't joking, Coca-Cola consists of a trace quantity of phosphoric acid. To attempt this, drain the toilet bowl to below where the rust marks are. Then soak some Coke. Clean with a soft fabric and then more Coke, over and over, and so on. If that does not suffice then use Naval Jelly which consists of a lot more phosphoric acid (be sure to check out the instructions and safety cautions initially!). Naval Jelly is what we here at ® use to get rid of rust discolorations and it's readily offered at many hardware stores.</p>
