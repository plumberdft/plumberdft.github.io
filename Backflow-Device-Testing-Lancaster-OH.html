<p>The rust inside the pipe can break off and be performed through the taps. This will trigger your water to look rusty or brown, and the water may have a bad or foul smell to it. When the piping in your home begins to reveal any of these indications of deterioration, you will inevitably need to repipe the whole plumbing system.
