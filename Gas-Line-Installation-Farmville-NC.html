The new inlets and outlets on the tank do not constantly line up with the old supply lines. Solder in a set of 45-degree fittings to offset each line if required. Also replace the old shutoff valve with a new ball valve while you're at it (Picture 6). Vent sizes are sized according to the heat output of the water heater.

They do not have a lawn sprinkler, or any outdoor watering system at all, so they do not need backflow prevention.

<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. happens when there is a decline in supplied pressure to the water circulation. The result is a backflow where liquid in the pipe sector flows in reverse relative to the instructions of the system's water supply movement. This opposite circulation is normally localized and can arise from a loss in upstream pressure from, for example, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more typical in smaller pipes subject to automobile traffic on overlaying roadways, vibrations from adjacent heavy equipment operations, settlement of close-by soil or moving foundations, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as valves and meters, etc. The result is a complete breakage, dislocation or cracking in the pipe that permits water to escape. Often no obvious physical damage to the pipe is required, just the mechanical failure of an essential pump whose shut down results in a substantial pressure drop across the pipe network.</p>
