<p>Backflow is bad news. Clamp the drain hose. The water softener needs to drain the diminished salt water solution after the regrowth cycle. Clamp the drain hose firmly and feed it into the dedicated drain, like a floor drain or utility sink. To avoid the hose back siphoning waste water, all drain hose pipes need to have an air space. The end of the hose be at least two inches above the devoted drain. An air gap may be used to accomplish this, and might be required depending on local plumbing codes.</p>

Lubricant does not assist the assembly work any better, it is only there to assist the service technician assemble the parts into the body without creating damage from friction. The lubricant should be a food grade lube to assure the water system is not polluted. Oftentimes the very best lube is water. The usual usage for lubricant in the repair process, is on 'rings (not guides). All 'rings should be lightly lubricated to ensure they do not present of their retainer.

We suggest installing carbon monoxide detectors outside of bedroom doors to inform you of any possible gas leakages if you have not done so already.</p>
