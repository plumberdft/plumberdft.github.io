<p>For the function of water treatment, hardness is measured in either grains per gallon (gpg) or parts per million (ppm). Grains per gallon is specified as one grain (64.8 mg) of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) liquified in one United States gallon (3.785 l) of water. Parts per million is specified as one milligram of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) per litre of water. To transform in between gpg and ppm use the following factor; 1 gpg = 17.1 ppm.
