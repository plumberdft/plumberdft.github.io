<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the simplest and most typical kind of device. It has two check valves in an entirely closed body-- two layers of backflow protection. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow situation. When you ultimately test a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That implies that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The downside of a DC is that if the first line of defense stops working and the second line of defense stops working (both examine valves fail to hold), a backflow circumstance might take place.
