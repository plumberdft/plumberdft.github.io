<h3>The Dreaded Blocked Toilet in Bensalem PA</h3>
<p>What is tough water? Scientifically speaking, it is water which contains significant quantities of dissolved minerals, specifically calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it gets these minerals on its journey. Depending on how long the water travels through the ground before reaching your tap, it can get a lot of these minerals, making water harder in some regions than others. While the minerals won't harm your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and quite a nuisance-- for its numerous desired uses around your home.</p>

<p>During the regeneration cycle, salt water (brackish water developed in the brine tank by mixing water and salt) is travelled through the resin tank (either up or down depending on the design).

This procedure continues up until all the hardness ions are exchanged with the salt ions (you'll notice small amounts of salt going to drain in addition to the firmness ions) and the bed is considered fully restored.</p>
