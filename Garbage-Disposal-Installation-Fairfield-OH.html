The result is a backflow where liquid in the pipe section streams in reverse relative to the instructions of the system's water system motion. This opposite flow is normally localized and can result from a loss in upstream pressure from, for instance, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more common in smaller sized pipes based on automobile traffic on overlaying streets, vibrations from surrounding heavy equipment operations, settlement of close-by soil or shifting foundations, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as meters and valves, etc. The result is a total breakage, dislocation or breaking in the pipe that permits water to escape.
