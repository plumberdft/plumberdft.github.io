<p>A water softener has a resin tank consisting of countless small resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. When newly regenerated, the beads become full of salt ions from the water softener salt. As tough water passes through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are attracted to the resin beads. There, salt ions are exchanged for the tough water ions. The softener system then provides soft water for your use. Tough water causes white or gray deposits when water is warmed. Water softening can be utilized to reduce these symptoms.</p>
<p>In this technique, water is treated with a calculated amount of washing soda (Na2CO3) which converts the chlorides and sulphates of calcium and magnesium into their particular carbonates which get precipitated.
