Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates data on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to understand what the field test information suggests for that particular assembly.

<p>The majority of toilets utilized today run with a standard gravity flushing style, suggesting they use the force of the gravity to push the clean water into the bowl and then on into the sewage system.

<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast majority of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in.. The majority of home centers carry just one or 2 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest much more. If there's a door near the toilet, also determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with an elongated" design, the door may not close. Read on to discover how to install a toilet.</p>
