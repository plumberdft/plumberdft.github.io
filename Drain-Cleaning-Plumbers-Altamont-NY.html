<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the easiest and most typical kind of device. It has 2 check valves in an entirely closed body-- two layers of backflow protection. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow circumstance. When you eventually test a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That implies that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The drawback of a DC is that if the first line of defense fails and the second line of defense fails (both examine valves fail to hold), a backflow scenario might take place. That is why this type of valve is not defined for what a public utility thinks about high danger" establishments.</p>
