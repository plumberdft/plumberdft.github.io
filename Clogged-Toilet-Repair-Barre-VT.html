The consumer has one month to finish installation and testing of a backflow prevention assembly (inspect the due date on Notification of Requirements form). Seattle Public Utilities requires that any cross connection have a backflow preventer. The backflow preventer might be needed to be found on the water service line, within the building, or both places. After a preliminary inspection and testing of a freshly set up backflow preventer, the water customer is required to have the backflow preventer tested on an annual basis.</p>
<p>The use of different metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic deterioration Direct contact in between different metals will initiate the development of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever 2 various kinds of metal are conductively linked to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is developed because of the process. When galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe, a typical example of this is. It is also worth keeping in mind that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to reduce this direct contact between the different metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating product that physically separates contact in between the 2 metals.</p>
