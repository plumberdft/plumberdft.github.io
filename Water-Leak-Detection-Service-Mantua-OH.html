<p>Leakages are tricky. While the time needed will vary based upon your home size and the variety of found malfunctions, it's best to set aside approximately two hours when you set up an inspection. There's always the chance that your plumber's previous job will run long and delay the starting time. If the plumber finishes in 15 minutes, and dashes off to their next consultation, they likely hurried the job (unless you have a really little plumbing system). Ask how long the inspection typically takes when you call to schedule your appointment.</p>
