<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water adopted the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Consequently residential authorizations released after that date require a testable backflow assembly for the fire lawn sprinkler. The assembly was tested at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was checked was attached. By code this backflow assembly must be checked every year. Also permits issued for sub-meters with backflow preventers for lawn irrigation systems need a yearly test. It is required that this assembly is checked in the spring before operating the irrigation system. All testable backflow preventers need to be checked each year to insure the security of the drinkable drinking water in your house.
