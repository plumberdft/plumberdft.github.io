Backflow is a problem since it can cause wastewater to flow back into a house, contaminating the drinking water. Cover the flapper valve with your hand. Switch on the water (very carefully, so you don't get a cold shower!) and let it eliminate the toilet valve for a couple of seconds.</p>
<p>Your initial step is to shut off the water. For the most part, you'll have a shutoff valve right beside the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you don't have a shutoff, switch off the water supply at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your home. This is a good time to add a shutoff valve next to the toilet or replace one that leakages. This is likewise a good time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Image 6). A versatile supply line enhanced with a metal sleeve costs about $7 in the house centers and hardware shops. Pictures 1 - 8 show how to replace the valve. Set the height before you install the valve (Photo 5) if the height of your valve is adjustable. Check the instructions if your valve is a various style from the one we reveal. After mounting the valve (Picture 6), connect the fill tube (Photo 7).</p>
