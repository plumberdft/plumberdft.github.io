Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adjust to your organisation' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation need, tanks come online to add flow rate capability. Throughout durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation innovation, and it's probably the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
