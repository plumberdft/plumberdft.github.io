<h3>Clearing Blocked Drains at Shippensburg PA</h3>

Turn off the power and water, then unplug the disposal (If it's hardwired, shut off the breaker.) Remove the rubber baffle inside the drain-most just raise out-and shine a flashlight into the hole. Fish out the blockage with a pair of tongs or needle-nose pliers. For example, backflow can occur when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for use. Water is no longer being pushed forward into your home and will flow backwards into the city water lines due to the fact that pressure is lost throughout these occasions.</p>
