<p>Storage centers and surge tanks are generally installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, usually between and aqueduct and the circulation water mains. These are facilities developed for the short-term staging of water materials and include water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as flow regulators instead of water storage units. Considering that water need differs throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source remain roughly continuous, usage never exactly matches supply. As so for those durations where water flow is higher than need (typically night-time hours), the excess water supply is securely and easily saved for later usage when need rate exceeds supply (usually throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
