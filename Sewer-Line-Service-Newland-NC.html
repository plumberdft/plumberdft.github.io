<p>Will sears install my waste disposal unit for me. The most basic backflow prevention device is the barometric loop. This is just a non-mechanical pipe length forming a loop extending a minimum of 35 feet vertically above the water system pipeline. The height is required to overcome the ambient air pressure (at mean sea level) of 34 feet of head (14.6959 psi). A loop of pipe this high prevents a siphon from forming. Its benefits are the simplicity of its style and absence of moving parts. However, it might be unwise in many circumstances to install a pipe section of this length. Additionally, a barometric loop will not avoid back pressure from forming as the result of a pump failure.</p>
