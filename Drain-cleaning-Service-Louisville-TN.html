These minerals don't make water unhealthy to drink. They likewise are reasonably undetectable through odor or taste, but they can be damaging just the very same. Just like our trenchless services, we will first conduct pipe leak tests using video and hydraulic pressure tests.</p>

Most residential water heaters cost $150 to $400 for either gas or electrical, plus $200 to $450 if you have a plumber install it. More pricey gas water heaters with special venting systems likewise are offered. But they're harder to install, and we won't handle them here.</p>
