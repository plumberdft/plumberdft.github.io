<p>Changing the ring that seals the connection between the sewer and the bowl line implies completely eliminating the entire toilet. So it's a. good time to think about getting a brand brand-new toilet. A toilet auger works the opposite way that a plunger does. Rather than removing the obstruction with negative pressure, it in fact presses into the obstruction, working further into where the blockage is happening.
