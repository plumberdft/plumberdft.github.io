<p>A. If you have rust spots, using phosphoric acid typically will help remove them. , if you would like to try the gentlest method perhaps try utilizing some Coke on the rust initially.. No, we aren't joking, Coca-Cola consists of a trace quantity of phosphoric acid. To attempt this, drain the toilet bowl to below where the rust marks are. Then pour on some Coke. Clean with a soft fabric and after that more Coke, over and over, and so on. Then use Naval Jelly which consists of a lot more phosphoric acid (be sure to check out the instructions and security cautions first!), if that doesn't do the technique. Naval Jelly is what we here at ® use to get rid of rust spots and it's easily available at most hardware stores.</p>
