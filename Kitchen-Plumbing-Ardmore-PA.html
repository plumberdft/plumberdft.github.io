<h3>The 5 Most Useful Tools For De-Clogging in Ardmore PA</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves need to remain open and the system should be continually kept track of. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as basic as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm system that alerts the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems use both techniques. NFPA 13 describes all such gadgets as supervisory devices.</p>
<p>In addition to the specific facilities listed above, an authorized backflow prevention assembly need to be set up on each potable water service connection to any facilities consisting of a real or potential  threat.

The minimum approved backflow prevention assembly for unlisted risks will be determined on a case-by-case basis by the Cross Connection Control Program.</p>
