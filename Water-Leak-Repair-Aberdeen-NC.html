<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health risk for people on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Usually, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how difficult the water was to begin with. Harder water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this increase in salt is minor, however if you have actually been advised by a physician to follow a stringent low salt diet plan this increase can pose problems.</p>
