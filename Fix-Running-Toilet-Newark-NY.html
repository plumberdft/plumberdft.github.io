<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of one or more affected areas of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to only abandon the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, attics and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost extremely quickly. This is the main reason why we will recommend a full repipe in certain communities, based upon our experience.</p>
