<p>A water softener draws magnesium and calcium out of the water in order to "soften" it. However to do so, it should put something back into the water. Most water softeners utilize an ion exchange process where calcium and magnesium ions are exchanged for sodium ions in the system's resin tank. This tank is filled with resin beads, and the hardness ions (calcium and magnesium) connect themselves to these. The tank flushes itself when certain levels are fulfilled, and the system will need to have the salt in the salt water tank replenished.</p>

Customer Private investigator Jodi Brooks called around to try to get an estimate from personal plumbers for a garbage disposal replacement. None of business we called would provide an estimate over the phone. All of them wanted to look at the scenario before dedicating to a rate, and all wished to charge a service fee to come out. Brooks found only one plumber who would come out without charging.</p>
