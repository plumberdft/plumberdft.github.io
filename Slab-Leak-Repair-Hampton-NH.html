A toilet auger works the opposite method that a plunger does. Rather than dislodging the blockage with unfavorable pressure, it in fact presses into the blockage, working even more into where the blockage is occurring. The auger or snake" is then used to press the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear course for water to stream freely. The auger's corkscrew-shaped pointer helps force it even more down into the clog, making it simpler to clear.</p>
