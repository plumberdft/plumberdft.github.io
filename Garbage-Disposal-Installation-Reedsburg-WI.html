<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the simplest and most typical type of device. It has two check valves in an entirely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow protection. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow circumstance. When you ultimately evaluate a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That means that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The disadvantage of a DC is that if the first line of defense fails and the 2nd line of defense stops working (both inspect valves stop working to hold), a backflow scenario could occur. That is why this kind of valve is not defined for what a water company considers high danger" facilities.</p>
<p>Difficult water, particles from old pipes or particles from a break in a city water line can prevent a flush valve from closing entirely.
