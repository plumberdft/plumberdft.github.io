<p>Once the parts are placed back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is ready to be pressurized. It is necessary to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the disadvantage shut off remains in the closed position. This enables the parts to transfer to their pressurized positions in a precise movement. Once the assembly is pressurized, then any collected air should be gotten rid of from the body. Many backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be gotten rid of from vital areas in the assembly. In some designs, test cocks can be used to remove air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a place where the air will accumulate.</p>
<p>To the end user (consumer), SpringWell Water (SpringWell") warrants that the following Covered products- retention tanks and mineral tanks (14" or larger) shall be free of any flaws in material and workmanship for a period of 10-years under normal application, service and use. They were running a bit late due to earlier service calls, but I give the company props for calling to update us on the later arrival time. Some tasks take longer than anticipated, that's reasonable, by keeping us informed of the minor hold-up, we didn't have to worry.</p>
