<p>Your first step is to turn off the water. In many cases, you'll have a shutoff valve right next to the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you do not have a shutoff, shut off the water system at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your house. This is a good time to include a shutoff valve next to the toilet or replace one that leakages. This is likewise a great time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Photo 6). A versatile supply line strengthened with a metal sleeve costs about $7 in the house centers and hardware stores. Photos 1 - 8 show how to replace the valve. Set the height prior to you install the valve (Picture 5) if the height of your valve is adjustable. If your valve is a different style from the one we show, inspect the instructions. After mounting the valve (Photo 6), connect the fill tube (Image 7).</p>
