<p>After eliminating standing water from the sink, pour about 1/2 cup of table salt down the drain prior to you pour in the boiling water. Let it sit for a couple of minutes, and then flush with hot water to clear the mix. Have steel or iron piping and notification rust-colored water originating from your water home appliances?
