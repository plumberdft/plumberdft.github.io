<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  procedure filters the water through an exchange media referred to as resin or zeolite. Generally, the resin is a synthetic or natural , sand-like material covered with favorably charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is developed. The water streams through the system while the resin releases its sodium ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now considered soft.</p>
