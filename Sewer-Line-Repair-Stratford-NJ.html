<p>You'll need a special waste disposal unit if you home uses a septic system and drain field. The system should grind the waste even finer to prevent obstructions and allow the tank to be able to drain properly into the leach fields. As soon as, the gas pipe comes up from the ground (called the riser"), it can continue to be covered, but needs to then shift to galvanized. I am not sure why that need to be. It is also allowed to use black iron if it is probably coated with a galvanized covering (which is generally an unique paint"). When plumbing in their gas meters, PG&E often does this.</p>
<p>Even if you take great care of your drains by covering them and preventing pouring any liquid fat, oil, and grease down them, sometimes clogs are inescapable.
