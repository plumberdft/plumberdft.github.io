<p>Soft drink dispensers (post-mix carbonators) use carbonated water mixed under pressure with syrup and water to offer sodas drinks. Many, if not most, water pipes are made of copper. When carbonated water enters contact with copper it chemically liquifies the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate service (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has actually been proven to be a threat to the digestive system. The Universal Plumbing Code requires that the authorized backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a minimized pressure backflow assembly (RPZ).
