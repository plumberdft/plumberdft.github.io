<p>Dual Inspect Valve - Model GF8080, GF8080E - The Dual Inspect Valve or double backflow prevention valve is basically a stripped down Double Check Valve without shut off valves and test dicks. They are non-testable and are usually utilized by public utility and installed after a water meter to prevent the meter from running backwards and low defense versus backflow. This tool is the center of controversy with many backflow authorities and should never be puzzled with Double Check Valves. Contact local authorities for required installation, as most do not recognize these as backflow prevention devices.</p>
<p>More complex is the double check valve assembly (DCVA). This device has found extensive usage considering that it avoids both siphonage and back pressure. The paired check valves are arranged in line with the pipeline and run individually of each other. A set of 4 test dicks allow the operator to analyze the valves and make certain they are not being forced open by collected particles. Each spring-loaded check valve is set to enable water at awaited functional pressure to flow through. Should backflow take place, either due to siphonage or back pressure, the springs slam the valves shut tight, avoiding the entrance of cross contamination water.</p>

<h3>Basic Plumber Tools For Any Job Clearfield UT</h3>
<p>Often, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as basic as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates data on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to understand what the field test data implies for that specific assembly.  When a qualified tester translates the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
