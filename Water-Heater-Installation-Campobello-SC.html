Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adjust to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow need, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capability. During periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation innovation, and it's perhaps the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>

The word siphonage" is really crucial here.  This device only breaks the vacuum to drain water and will not secure against back pressure.
