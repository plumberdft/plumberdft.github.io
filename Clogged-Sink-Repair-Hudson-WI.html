<p>Recent Evaluation: Button Plumbing was excellent. They changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was quite affordable. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was super happy with their service.</p>
