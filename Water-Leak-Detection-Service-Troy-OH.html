Domestic water that shows up to your Ohio home carries minerals that can trigger rust on metal parts and elements. To prevent corrosion from rust, storage tanks are equipped with a bar made with magnesium called an anode rod. The rod protects the tank by drawing in harmful products. By having the anode rod checked regularly and changed as required, you can double the life of your hot water heater.</p>

Because you have to move quickly in the face of a gas leak, having a plumbing company on hand that you can call is crucial.
