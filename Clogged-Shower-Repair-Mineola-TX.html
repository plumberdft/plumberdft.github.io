Costing less than a full repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost extremely rapidly.

New meters should meet guidelines and code requirements for their positioning, and gas service providers may need a special meter for their services, limiting your choices. Contractors and do-it-yourselfers are responsible for scheduling inspections by calling the office number listed on the structure permit. Inspections should be made after foundation excavation (prior to pouring concrete), after rough-in (before concealing work), and upon completion. KEEP IN MIND: If defective work is found, the inspector will issue an infraction notice, and a particular amount of time is allotted to fix the problem.</p>

This process continues up until all the hardness ions are exchanged with the salt ions (you'll observe small amounts of salt going to drain together with the hardness ions) and the bed is considered totally restored.</p>
