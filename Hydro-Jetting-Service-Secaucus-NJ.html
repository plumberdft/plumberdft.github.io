A garbage disposal can decrease a home's total garbage output by crushing most typical food scraps so they can be gotten rid of through the sink as wastewater.

WaterBoss water softener systems feature an entire house water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain.
