About 10 percent more potassium chloride salt is utilized during the backflush operation. What we imply is that your toilet is old. Older toilets might work simply fine, however if your toilet is truly old (and outdated in design), you might wish to consider a toilet replacement service by Vegas Valley Plumbing.
