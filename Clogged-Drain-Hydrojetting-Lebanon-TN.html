<p>Reducing or removing water firmness is made with a tool called a water softener.  It is inside this softener where the ion exchange process occurs. A softener is consisted of different components, each having their own special function. The heart of the softener is the mineral tank which is a pressure vessel generally built out of fiberglass.  These tanks are filled with adversely charged ion exchange resin.  The brains of the softener lie in the control valve or softener head as it is commonly referred to. Most popular water softeners have an automated regenerating system.  The most basic type has an electrical timer that recharges the system and flushes on a regular schedule.</p>
