<p>Requirements in NFPA 13: Requirement for the Installation of Sprinkler Systems for installing backflow preventers and in NFPA 25: Requirement for the Inspection, Testing and Maintenance of Water-Based Fire Security Systems for performing yearly forward circulation tests are often perceived as a mandate to have them. But the intent of the code is to only attach installation and ITM requirements to systems where backflow preventers exist. Recent Evaluation: A journeyman plumber and his assistant arrived during the selected period. They unplugged the sinks, cleaned up and suggested a tool to be used in the future.</p>
<p>Where the company lies: Be cautious of contractors who offer you a post workplace box with no street address or usage only an answering service. If he or she pressures you to work with fast and pay money up front, never ever work with somebody who comes unsolicited to your door and can't supply you evidence of qualifications-- specifically. Grey = End-User Pressure - water presses past the # 2 check valve into the system of completion user. The # 2 Examine prevents backflow brought on by pressure increases in the down stream plumbing.</p>
