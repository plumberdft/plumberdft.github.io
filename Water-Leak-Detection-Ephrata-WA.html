If you smell a gas leak in or around your home, there are safety precautions you must take to secure yourself, your household and your home. Some jurisdictions likewise enable alternatives to backflow preventers. For example, Philadelphia's water district requires all residential systems supplying devoted sprinkler heads to have a connection from the lawn sprinkler to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water system. This eliminates the need for a backflow preventer, because each time that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
