<h3>Plumbing Drainage & Heating Danville VA</h3>
<p>In some cases, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as basic as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates data on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to know what the field test information implies for that specific assembly.  When a trained tester interprets the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
