<p>Soft drink dispensers (post-mix carbonators) utilize carbonated water blended under pressure with syrup and water to provide soft drinks drinks. Many, if not most, water pipes are made of copper.

Additional requirements: no piping consisting of copper will be set up downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies supplying carbonators.</p>
