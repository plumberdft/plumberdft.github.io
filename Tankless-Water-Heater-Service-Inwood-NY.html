<p>Current Evaluation: Button Plumbing was great. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was rather reasonable. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely pleased with their service.</p>
<p>Low Water Pressure - Low water pressure is the leading concern with most houses and business' alike. Simply stated it's tough to get casserole meals or any big serving piece clean with no pressure in the faucet or sprayer. Mineral deposits are also a major offender, blockages from food bits, obstructions in aerator screens all definitely stop water circulation. The most major might be water leaking, blocked lines to the cut off, or perhaps worse a frozen pipe entering into the house or structure.</p>
