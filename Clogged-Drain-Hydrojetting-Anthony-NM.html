<p>Your Local Plumbing, Heating & Cooling Professionals Since 1938. You'll see the distinction the very first time you bathe or shower with softened water. Soft water feels visibly smooth to the skin. It likewise makes your house simple to clean by minimizing hard-water build-up. High water pressure also damages plumbing. The water entering the house puts excess pressure on faucet seal, water shut down valves and supply lines, and toilets. High water pressure leads to leakages, running toilets and other plumbing problems that will continue to take place without correct pressure reduction.</p>
<p>A water softener draws magnesium and calcium out of the water in order to "soften" it. However to do so, it should put something back into the water. A lot of water softeners use an ion exchange procedure where calcium and magnesium ions are exchanged for sodium ions in the system's resin tank. This tank is filled with resin beads, and the hardness ions (calcium and magnesium) attach themselves to these. The tank flushes itself when certain levels are met, and the system will need to have the salt in the brine tank renewed.</p>
