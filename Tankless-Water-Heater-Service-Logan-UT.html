<p>Organic debris, such as food, grease, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's drain, snake or cable auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, however this isn't a beginner's Do It Yourself task. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leaks - so it deserves it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
<p>It is crucial to make sure the equipment is always working to the best of its capabilities when it comes to your water heater. Nevertheless, there are several variables that can provide problems and prevent the efficiency of your unit. Need to you experience any problem with your system, from lack of warm water to a leaking tank, contact Johnson Heating & Cooling for an inspection. We will find out just what is triggering the problem. You can depend on us for instant service throughout Greenwood and surrounding locations in Central Indiana.</p>
<p>Sometimes a clog can be triggered due to buildup and grease within the system. If this is the case, snaking the drain will not fix the concern. You might need to look into using a high pressure water system to eliminate the clog. This procedure is a bit more pricey and will cost anywhere from $400-$ 1000, depending upon the intensity of the clog. At the time of inspection, make sure to leave all of the gas piping exposed so the inspector can take a look at the entire system.</p>
