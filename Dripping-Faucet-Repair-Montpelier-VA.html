When installing the plumbing to your softener, take your time and ensure your fittings are threaded well and your push-to-connect fittings are seated correctly. If the bypass valve is broken, it can likewise trigger the system to leak. Bypass valves are fitted with -rings that may need to be re-lubricated or replaced over time. A cracked rotor valve or rotor valve seal may also be the perpetrator. The rotor valve directs the water throughout the system during softening and regrowth procedures.

<p>Storage facilities and surge tanks are typically set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, normally in between and aqueduct and the distribution water mains. These are centers created for the short-term staging of water products and consist of water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary tanks, and lined ponds.
