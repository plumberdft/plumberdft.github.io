<p>Storage centers and rise tanks are generally installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, generally in between and aqueduct and the circulation water pipe. These are facilities developed for the short-term staging of water supplies and consist of water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as flow regulators rather than water storage units. Considering that water demand varies throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source remain approximately consistent, use never exactly matches supply. As so for those durations where water flow is higher than need (generally night-time hours), the excess supply of water is securely and easily kept for later usage when demand rate goes beyond supply (normally throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and night).</p>
