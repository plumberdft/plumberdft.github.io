<p>Will sears install my waste disposal unit for me. The easiest backflow prevention device is the barometric loop. This is simply a non-mechanical pipe length forming a loop extending a minimum of 35 feet vertically above the supply of water pipeline. The height is essential to conquer the ambient atmospheric pressure (at mean sea level) of 34 feet of head (14.6959 psi). A loop of pipe this high prevents a siphon from forming.

Furthermore, a barometric loop will not avoid back pressure from forming as the result of a pump failure.</p>
