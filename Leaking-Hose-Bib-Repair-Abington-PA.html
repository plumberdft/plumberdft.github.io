<p>The term hard water describes water with a high mineral content. These minerals can differ depending upon which area of the nation you remain in, however most frequently consist of calcium, magnesium, bicarbonates, and sulfates.

These mineral deposits stay when the water is routed into pipes for commercial and residential use, unless the water is softened or filtered.</p>
<p>When you get rid of the cap to flush out the valve, check the washer for wear or cracks. Replacing a bad washer is cheap and simple. However discovering the best washer might not be. The most common washers are often available in the house centers and hardware shops. Other styles can be difficult to find.
