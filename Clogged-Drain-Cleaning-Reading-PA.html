<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adjust to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capability. During periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive flow innovation, and it's perhaps the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
