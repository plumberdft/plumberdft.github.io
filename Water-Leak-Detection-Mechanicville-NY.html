I in fact got their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me an estimate. They instantly cleared the initial obstruction, permitting the occupants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon additional examination, there was a significant blockage that needed excavation to investigate. His group was on website the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial problem and setting up a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
