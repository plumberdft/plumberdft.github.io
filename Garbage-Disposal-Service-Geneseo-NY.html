<p>The rust inside the pipe can break off and be performed through the taps. This will trigger your water to look rusty or brown, and the water may have a bad or nasty odor to it. When the piping in your house begins to reveal any of these indications of rust, you will inevitably need to repipe the whole plumbing system. The factor a toilet won't flush might be a low water level in the tank or a clogged inlet. A clog in the trap or drain below the toilet can also be the cause. Working with a licensed Montgomery County plumber is your primary step; a plumber can detect the problem and repair it.</p>
<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health threat for people on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Generally, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how tough the water was to begin with. Harder water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in salt is minor, however if you have actually been advised by a physician to follow a rigorous low salt diet this increase can pose problems.</p>
