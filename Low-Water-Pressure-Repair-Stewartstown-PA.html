<h3>Blocked Sewer in Stewartstown PA - Some Vital Info You Should Know</h3>
<p>I had a significant sewer issue with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I could find on Google. I really got their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and provide me an estimate. They instantly cleared the initial obstruction, allowing for the renters to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon further examination, there was a substantial obstruction that needed excavation to examine. His team was on site the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial concern and setting up a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
<p>Roto-Rooter was featured in the SyFy television show Ghost Hunters (2004-2016) as the 2 creators of TAPS work for Roto-Rooter as plumbers in the company's Providence, Rhode Island branch.
