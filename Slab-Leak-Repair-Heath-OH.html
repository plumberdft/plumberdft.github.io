<p>Conductor piping, when going into a City mix sewer, should be trapped, either separately or a single trap not to exceed 10 inches in size. These traps will consist of a cleanout to grade. Single traps will be installed, whenever possible, within five feet of the beyond exterior walls. Some disposals are connected to the dishwasher, which allows for self-cleaning. This location typically suffers from leakages also. This might be due to a backup of clogged sewage that cant get to the main sewer lines.</p>
<p>When there are fractures or holes in your sewer line, sewer line repair is recommended. If damage is extreme, replacement of the line is recommended. These are all indications that your system need to be examined by a plumber.

You need to also prevent using any type of chemical drain cleaners on your garbage disposal since these chemicals will only harm the appliance even more.</p>
