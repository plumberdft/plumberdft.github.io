<p>Salt is typically added to the reservoir throughout regeneration of the softener. The more often a softener is regenerated, the more often salt needs to be included. The rate to fix a toilet will depend on what is exactly wrong with the toilet and whether we have easy access to deal with the toilet. If you are trying to find a specific price quote, we provide free plumbing quotes, and among our plumbers will pertain to your house and have the ability to supply a precise quote.</p>
<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health danger for people on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to lower its mineral content. Normally, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how tough the water was to begin with. Harder water will result in more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this increase in salt is minor, but if you've been advised by a physician to follow a rigorous low salt diet this boost can pose problems.</p>
