<p>You'll need an unique garbage disposal if you home uses a septic system and drain field. The system should grind the waste even finer to prevent obstructions and permit the tank to be able to drain properly into the leach fields. As soon as, the gas pipe shows up from the ground (called the riser"), it can continue to be wrapped, but must then transition to galvanized. I am unsure why that need to be. It is likewise enabled to use black iron if it is probably coated with a galvanized covering (which is generally an unique paint"). When plumbing in their gas meters, PG&E often does this.</p>
