One of the most effective gadgets we have is the cable drain cleaning machine, also called the 'drain snake'. This machine clears drains and sewers by rotating a flexible cable made from wire through the pipe. Attachments at the end of the cable help the procedure by scraping, boring, cutting pipe clogs like roots and sludge. Every type of pipe obstruction is different and needs knowledge of the proper size cable and the best cutting head.

<p>Backflow preventers ought to only be repaired when the data gathered from the field test shows the assembly has broken down in its performance below the established minimum basic. The test procedure is a diagnostic evaluation of the operations of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer fails to fulfill this minimum basic, the backflow preventer should be fixed or if required, replaced. These minimum requirements are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly starts to degrade in its performance, it can still prevent backflow. The purpose of a repair is to return the assembly back to its original factory working specs. This indicates the assembly is repaired so that it can perform above the minimum requirement.</p>
