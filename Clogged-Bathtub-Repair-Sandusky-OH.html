<h3>Residential Plumbing Emergencies Sandusky OH</h3>
<p>Sometimes, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as easy as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates information on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to know what the field test information indicates for that specific assembly.  When a trained tester interprets the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>

The quote was sensible and they salvaged whatever they might to keep our costs down. Will be using them again in the future.
