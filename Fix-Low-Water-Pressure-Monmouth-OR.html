<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves need to stay open and the system needs to be constantly kept an eye on. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as easy as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm that alerts the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems make use of both approaches. NFPA 13 refers to all such devices as supervisory devices.</p>
