<p>In this circumstance, dirty water from the hillside pool will back- siphon or back-flow down the hosepipe and into the clean water tank. Double flush valves are becoming increasingly more common, as both customers and producers seek new ways to conserve water. Double flush toilets permit the user to pick the level of water needed to flush the toilet based on whether the waste is liquid or solid. We have actually all heard the old saying, "If it's yellow, let it mellow. If it's brown, flush it down."

<p>To assist prevent blockages within the tee (a repercussion of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will connect the disposer discharge directly to the tee of an end-outlet constant waste, instead of use the method set out above.

When the waste must travel horizontally (down the arm) and then change direction to fall down the trap, this is particularly true. Having the disposer discharge straight down into the tee permits a direct line to the trap that's relatively friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs in between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
