Momentary water will be enabled after the contractor sets up a hose bibb assembly consisting of a vertical PVC riser at the water meter with a hose bibb on a 90-degree elbow at the top.  A vacuum breaker should be attached to the hose bibb at all times.  The discharge opening from the vacuum breaker should be at least 12 inches above grade.  The riser should be strongly attached to durable rebar or wood stake to include structural stability to the assembly.  The direct connection between the water meter and the structure plumbing before the structure is substantially complete is restricted unless a double check backflow assembly is set up and right away checked to ensure it is working.</p>
