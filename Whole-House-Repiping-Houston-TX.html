Waste disposal unit warranties last an average of 5 years, but they can vary between 2 and 10 years. Because the average lifespan of a waste disposal unit is 12 years, you might want to buy an extended service warranty.

Backflow can likewise carry water into your plumbing if it is linked to any outside water source.
