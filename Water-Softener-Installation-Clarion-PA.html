<p>There are a couple of types of water heaters to pick from, each style has its drawbacks and advantages. The best one for you depends upon just how much hot water you use, and the heating method (electricity, gas, oil). Some claim to minimize energy costs by approximately 50 percent of standard storage designs. The compromise is that the initial costs are higher and your return on investment will take longer. CPVC (chlorinated polyvinyl chloride) is among the most typical types of plastic piping utilized in plumbing systems today. Among the reasons it's so popular is the cost, and it's known to withstand high temperatures. It is frequently used for hot water piping and drain pipes.</p>
