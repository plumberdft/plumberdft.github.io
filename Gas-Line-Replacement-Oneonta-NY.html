<p>Reverse osmosis is the process utilized to cleanse water utilized for drinking and cooking. The water in our RO system goes through three stages. In the prefilter stage, big particles like silt and rust are removed by the filter. Next the water goes through the membrane. Hydrogen and oxygen travel through the pores while liquified solids are caught and removed. Lastly, the water goes to the holding tank after going through one last stage of filtration to get rid of any leftover impurities.</p>

Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the firmness ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When hard water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and changed with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
